  <h2>Marketing</h2>
  <h4 class="mt-4">Communication message and objectives</h4>
  <h6>Message</h6>
  <p> We want to motivate people to prioritise their downtime as it’s crucial for their mental health. By providing a product that has several relaxing purposes and helping users to create their ideal moment to relaxation by making them think about what really helps them to relax and slow down. </p>
  <h6>Context </h6>
  <p>Our main platform that we use is Instagram. The reason for this is that during our interviews we found out that Instagram is the main platform that our interviewees use. It is the first app they use in the morning and the last app they use before going to sleep. It is a platform where different forms of communication can be used: visual content (pictures and videos) and text. </p>
  <h6>Reach objectives</h6>
  <p>We want to get an average of 500 views for our video content. Reels do very well in the algorithm, hence we expect that it is easier to get more impressions than for instance photo content. Nonetheless, it is one of the measurable ways to see how many impressions our content has.</p>
  <h6> Affect objectives</h6>
  <br>
  <p> - We want our audience to feel like our platform is a safe platform. <br>
    - We want to create a sense of community, for this it is important that our audience feels comfortable with our platform, also when interacting with us. Nonetheless, there are many stress-factors in the lives of our consumers already, hence it is important that our platform doesn’t become an extra one. <br>
    - We want our audience to feel calm when they consume our content. As we stand for relaxation it is crucial that when our consumers consume our content or interact with our website they already feel something similar. Just like we mentioned in the first point, our brand should not be another stress factor. 
    We want the feeling of curiosity to arise before the launch of our website. As we are launching our website on the 14th of April 2022, we want to create a feeling of curiosity amongst (potential) consumers. We want this so there is more of a surprise factor when we launch our website.</p>
  <h6>Response objectives</h6>
  <br>
  <p> - We are aiming to get 100 followers before the 14th of April 2022. We think that this is a realistic number for a brand that has not launched its website and products yet and that is relatively new to the market. When we look at other beginning brands and due to the saturated algorithm it is, especially at the beginning, harder to get into the algorithm of social media and to properly reach our target audience. Hence, we are aiming for 100 followers.<br>
    - We want our audience to share how they relax to create a sense of community with the hashtag #allmetime. All me time stands for the time you create for yourself to relax. We want our followers to share how they do this. For example, while reading a book, mediting, taking a bath etc.. On our social media pages we share inspiration regarding this topic. </p>
  <h6>Target audience</h6>
  <p>Our target group are women that live in the Netherlands between the ages 25 to 34. We are focussing on women that have a bit more money to spend, therefore we are focussing on women from middle and upper class. The women from our target audience prioritise their careers, have busy lives and find it hard to find time for themselves. We have created a persona for our target audience:</p>
  <h6>Persona</h6>
  <p>Lisa, 29 - social media professional<br>
    - Lives together with her partner in their new apartment<br>
    - She tries to go to the gym 2-3 times per week<br>
    - She is very outgoing and therefore enjoys going out with friends<br>
    - She enjoys self care and doesn’t mind spending a bit more money on this<br>
    - Because she needs to take care of her household, work and social life she finds it hard to find time for herself<br>
    - She enjoys luxury products<br>
  </p>
  <h6>Media behaviour</h6>
  <p>We found out that our target audience mostly uses Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube. They use this the most in the morning and in the evenings. In the mornings they quickly scan through their socials and in the evenings they pay more attention and time on in. On workdays they usually check their socials around 7:30 and the times that they are on social in the evening start from 18:00 till the time they go to sleep. On weekends they usually conduct their social media around 10:00 and also during the day. They spend between 3-5 hours per day on these platforms in total. Other brands that they use are Chanel, Hugo Boss, Versace, Giorgio Armani and Yves Saint Laurant. When they are on social media they like to like, comment, read and watch videos. They also share content that they like with their friends. They are relatively influenced by social media. They especially are influenced by influencers that show a more ‘’real’’ look into their life as they seem more reliable. Other forms of media that they enjoy offline are journals like Vogue, Elle, Glamour and the Dutch magazine Linda. <br>
    We want to communicate that Kushi motivates ambitious women to prioritise their downtime as it’s crucial for their mental and physical health. By providing a product that has several relaxing purposes and helping users to create their ideal moment to relaxation by making them think about what really helps them to relax and slow down. Additionally, it improves the general quality of their life as you decrease your stress levels, take better care of yourself and therefore can enjoy quality time with your loved ones even more.</p>
  <h4 class="mt-4">Media tactics</h4>
  <p>As mentioned earlier our target audience has three main platforms that they use: Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube. We have decided to only focus on Instagram. The reason for this is that Snapchat is more for personal use with a closed circle. It is possible to share content with the public and go viral, but this is not as advanced as on platforms such as Instagram and TikTok. Furthermore, YouTube is mainly video content. It is not feasible for us to consequently post high quality YouTube videos. It is time-consuming and only after our products are launched can we actually start making videos with them (in the future YouTube could definitely be a next step. </p>
  <p>Instagram is the platform that is left. It is easy to use and navigate, you can post a wide variety of content forms on there and it is easy to build a brand image on the app. What we want to focus on are first of all the regular posts with pictures. We want to make use of inspiring content with pictures and quotes. The quotes are a great opportunity to get more reposts and to get our name out. Furthermore, we want to make use of reels. Video content is now one of the most famous forms of consuming content, therefore we want to make use of this. Besides this, reels have a higher chance of going viral and getting more impressions. It is however crucial to not only focus on reels as it leads to many impressions but the interaction with this content is very low (doesn’t necessarily lead to more followers, likes and comments). Furthermore, Instagram stories are a great opportunity to add more content to our page. It is a great opportunity to share more ‘’light’’ content, tips and short videos. We can put these stories in our highlights so new followers can still see what we have shared. Another advantage of Instagram is that it is easy to work with hashtags. As mentioned earlier, we have created the hashtag #allmetime. It is easy to navigate posts with this hashtag and you can even follow a hashtag. Hashtags on platforms such as YouTube and Snapchat are a bit less relevant. </p>
  <p>In the planning we will further elaborate on this, but we are planning on posting ‘’light content’’ such as quotes in the mornings and more time consuming content in the evenings as on average our target audience is less attentive when they scroll on instagram in the morning rather than in the evening. We chose a grid pattern for the feed as it is easy to maintain, is pleasing for the eyes and creates a clear structure. For the posting days we chose Wednesday, Thursday and Friday as on these days our target audience is the most active on social media. We posted our stories also in the afternoon (even though our target audience is mostly active in the evenings and mornings) because stories are not time bound besides that they disappear after 24 hours. After a few weeks (see planning) you will see how we take a small break from posting. Before this break we present our first brand video and our soft sell advertising. This is a warm up for the launch of our products. After a short radio silence we finally launched our products. After the launch of our products we follow up with the launch of the website and start focussing way more on the interaction between consumer and the brand as they can finally purchase and try out the product. As of now, we found out that video content works best with reaching new audiences so for future planning we want to focus way more on that. We are working out a plan for a collaboration between a meditation influencer and us to create an informational post so our followers can learn more about relaxing methods. </p>
  <h4 class="mt-4">Our Instagram</h4>
  <p>As you can see, we did not reach 100 followers. We think that this is because we mostly were posting pictures instead of videos. Therefore, like mentioned before, we will increase our video content. Furthermore, we did reach a lot of impressions on our video, namely over 1000. This is 200% of what we initially were planning on achieving. This again proved to us that video content is the way to go. </p>
