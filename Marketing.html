  <h2>Marketing</h2>
  <h4 class="mt-4">Context of the Campaign and Objectives</h4>
  <p>For this campaign we have set the objectives to reach 250 people with our social media account besides having 50 likes, 10 comments and 10 shares on our posts before the 17th of June. From these objectives we created a promotional campaign to increase the brand awareness of “Kushi”. With our brand; Kushi, we want to focus on the prioritization of women's down-time and me-time. We want to show how important it is to de-stress and implement relaxation methods into our target group's daily routine. Every person has their own way of relaxing, but the importance is not in how long it takes but the effectiveness of the routine. So with our promotional campaign we want to increase the brand awareness of our brand, with the help of influencer marketing and flowing along with the trends on both Instagram and TikTok, besides our own content The message we want to promote is the importance of prioritizing down-time on a daily basis, but that it does not have to be a difficult routine or method. <br> <br> We want to focus on quality and effectiveness rather than long and difficult routines that no one wants. We promote this message with the content we post on our social media platforms, having only a limited number of seconds to show our content (since a big portion of our content is going to be video content), it is the perfect way to show short routines, quick tips and tricks and experiences. With the help of influencers we want to make video content where they talk about the importance of down-time, tips and tricks and our product (how they would implement it in their daily routine and how it helps them relax). Influencers (especially in the relaxing/ skin care/ lifestyle scene) have great power and reach when it comes to introducing a brand. Since they have built a big following/ reach which makes it easier to influence people in using a brand or product. Besides that we want to use social media trends like certain sounds/music, templates of videos and hashtags to be able to reach our objective.The hashtag that we will be using is #mykushimoment. 

</p><br>
  <h4>Promotional Activities</h4><br>
<p>Since we are going to focus on both Instagram and TikTok for this promotional campaign, together with influencers and by following the social media trends we want to create our content. This content will be shared on specific days: we chose Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. During the week, we will be posting twice a day. This will be at 07:00 in the morning and 19:00 in the evening. In the weekend we will post on 11:00. The reasoning for the first two times is because our target audience are working ladies. The most common times to work at between 09:00 and 17:00. Therefore, we want to post when they are and can be active on social media. In the mornings, we will be posting lighter content that does not require as much attention, whereas in the evenings we will be posting content that has more ‘’meaning’’. On Saturday, we post at 11:00 as it is a free day of most of our target audience and there is more time in the morning to view our content. <br><br>

For Instagram we are thinking of combining our video content with some image content like; photography and imagery (plain images with text in the middle). The video content will contain: tutorials of how to use our products (optional: with an influencer), tips on how to relax (optional: with an influencer), tricks to relax when being at a certain place (work, home, etc) and effective routines of influencers regarding down-time and me-time. The imagery content will contain: tips, quotes, photography (photos of influencers and non famous people using our product, relaxing or with other relaxing methods. With this type of content we want to have a big variety of content on our account. Video content is now very popular. That is why a good portion of our content is video content, but we also want to provide more natural content. We also want to aim for an aesthetically pleasing feed, since this suits our brand. <br><br>

For TikTok we of course want to focus on video content (since this is only the type of content you are able to publish on the platform. We want to stay consistent throughout our platforms, so here we are also thinking of pushing similar content; tutorials of how to use our products (optional: with an influencer), tips on how to relax (optional: with an influencer), tricks to relax when being at a certain place (work, home, etc) and effective routines of influencers regarding down-time and me-time. <br><br>

To save time we are going to make videos beforehand and publish those videos on both Instagram and TikTok. The music on the videos will be music provided by the app itself (to prevent copyright problems), on TikTok we might add captions on the video itself since captions under the videos are not possible unlike Instagram. On Instagram we are able to add longer captions with deeper detail and information which help substantiate the video. Besides all that we want to use hashtags under our posts like: #relax #perfume #metime #downtime #chill and our own hashtags #kushi #kushiperfume #allmetime #kushidowntime #mykushimoment. This way the influencers can add our hashtags to their posts, and we are able to be found easier and if people visit the hashtag all of our posts are there to be found. <br> <br>
	
</p>
  <h4 class="mt-4">Media tactics</h4>
 <p>As mentioned before, we will be focussing on two platforms: Instagram and TikTok. Generally speaking, Instagram and TikTok are one of the biggest social media platforms out there. Instagram had 1.21 billion users in 2021 (Statista, 2021) and TikTok had 656 million downloads by 2021 (Statista, 2021). Both channels have a high reach and a wide target audience with countless opportunities that can lead to increased brand awareness. When you look at both platforms, these platforms are also used by brands to get their name out there and connect with their target audiences. For example, Calvin Klein, Guess and Vogue are fashion, lifestyle and beauty related and they are all active on these platforms. Especially in the last few years, influencers and trends have a high importance on these platforms. Influencers are oftentimes used to promote certain products and services with, and trends such as specific challenges, dances and songs are being used to ‘’go viral’’. Nonetheless, both platforms make use of hashtags, which are an efficient and easy way to find a way through the social media’s algorithms.</p><br>
<h4>Instagram</h4><br>
<p>Instagram is a platform that offers many different features, with the main ones being: posting pictures and videos. The feature of sharing pictures is relatively straightforward, however, sharing videos can be seen in more different ways. First of all, you can post shorter videos on your regular Instagram feed, but besides this, you can also share reels. Reels are videos that are usually between 30 to 60 seconds and can be viewed via the ‘’Reels’’ tab on the Instagram application. They have the tendency to find their way easier through the current Instagram algorithm and work well with the trend of short video content on social media. Instagram also has the feature ‘’stories’’, which is content that can be viewed for 24 hours and can later be saved to the Instagram page. The wide variety of content that can be presented on this platform is a benefit. How does this platform relate to our target audience and brand? Our target audience is females between the ages of 25 and 34. According to Statista, the biggest group that is active on Instagram are females between the ages 25 and 34, namely, 14.1% of all users (Statista, 2022). Besides desk-research proving that our target audience is active on this platform, we have conducted interviews and surveys ourselves with females that fit into our target audience. From these interviews, it turned out that each participant mentioned that Instagram is the main platform that they use. </p> <br>
<h4>Tiktok</h4>
<p>TikTok is mainly famous for its short video content. Besides this, they have features such as live streams which are also popular amongst users. The content shared on TikTok varies from being entertaining to being informative. Many companies are moving to these platforms due to their fast growth and efficient algorithm. It turns out that 49% of TikTok users are looking for something new on the platform. This makes it an ideal platform for a new, and still growing brand (Search Engine Journal, 2022). Furthermore, the high amount of trends and willingness to participate in trends is also a great opportunity to increase brand awareness. Even though there is a misconception that TikTok is mostly for a younger generation, approximately 17.1% of TikTok’s users are females between the ages 25 till 34. This is the second-largest group of users. The biggest group of users are females from 18 till 24 years old with 23.8%. When we conducted our interviews and surveys, we had some remarkable findings. Besides TikTok being one of their prefered platforms to use, several females mentioned that during their ‘’me-time’’ moments, their relaxation moments, they used TikTok. The classic story that we heard was that they loved to hang out on the couch and scroll through TikTok when their schedule finally allowed them to relax. This is a key finding that resulted in choosing TikTok as a platform. 
</p><br>
<h4>Learning Points</h4><br>
<p>We rearranged and created a new promotional campaign and it is working well. We implemented completely new strategies in this campaign: involving influencers, increasing video content and going with social media trends (for example using certain templates for the videos and images and trendy music). We saw that the video has more interactions than the images. Most people were more interested in the video content than the images; the quotes and images (of the product, influencers and ingredients). We learned a lot more about the behavior of the audience. Since our images had less impressions than our video content, the variation is still very important in the feed (especially when referencing the video content/ post in the image). Compared to our previous strategy, where 80% of our content images were with quotes and photos, did not really work out super well than with the content we now have published. Meaning that we did expect for the new content to have better impressions and reach than the previous content. Mainly because we used trends which are now very popular within the audience. Something we could not reach was influencing our target group in sharing our content on Instagram. It is already very difficult to build that type of relationship with the target group where they interact with the brand that way, and with all effort we still did not get the desired shares on our posts (that we had set in the Marketing and Communication Plan). The amount of shares on our posts is the one part that we could not reach as we had set in our objectives, we could not really find a way to push the audience into sharing the posts. We could also not really find a pattern of when they did share a post, what did push them to share it. So we could not really create a proper plan to influence the audience in sharing the posts we wanted then to share. So what we could do differently next time is trying to research deeply what triggers our target audience in sharing posts, and from that research make up an action plan. </p>
	<h4>Future Planning</h4><br>
<p>
In the last couple of weeks, we have been actively posting on our social media platforms of choice. We had picked our fixed days and times on which we wanted to post according to our findings. As we have picked a new strategy in comparison to our previous marketing strategy, there was a clear difference in how this approach worked. Video content did very well, on Instagram, we received many impressions on our reels, way more than our pictures. However, in terms of likes the likes were higher on pictures. Regardlessly, when you look at our objectives we are focussing on brand awareness, meaning that it is of higher value for us to get our name out there, rather than building a stronger connection with already existing followers. Therefore, focussing on video content on Instagram is definitely something we will keep doing. Even though the ‘’pictures’’ are getting less impressions, it’s not something we want to exclude from our future planning. This is because we still want to have variety in the content that we post, besides this, it is simply hard to create video content all the time as it takes relatively more time to create it. The consequences of this could be that we cannot post as frequently as we want. Something that we can consider to increase interactivity with the pictures is by creating content that people are more likely to save/repost on their own social media. We are already posting quotes, but increasing the quality of the quotes is a realistic option. Nonetheless, our current quotes are more ‘’serious’’, whereas by creating more ‘’funny’’ quotes or ‘’relatable’’ quotes our followers are more likely to repost them. Furthermore, we have currently simulated ‘’influencer marketing’’ as due to the time span and budget we were not able to actually get influencers on board. By actually investing in influencers and showing faces on our page that people recognize, we believe that picture content can also grow in likes and impressions.<br><br>

On TikTok we are of course only sharing video content. This has been going very well. Especially videos where we are jumping on certain trends or songs tend to have more impressions. We did find it hard to find ways to differentiate ourselves from others and stand out. Especially when jumping on trends, you tend to do similar things like others. For the future, we really want to look into creating something that is unique. We will take a step away from the most popular trends and focus more on creating our ‘’own’’ content. Something that we want to share on TikTok as well as Instagram are influencers sharing their own personal short ‘’Get Ready With Me’’ routine with our product. By allowing these influencers to stick a bit to their own style, we can involve and attract their followers, but we will show our other (potential) followers how our products can be used in different ways. Besides this, there is a big ‘’self care’’ community on both platforms. As mentioned before in the quotes that we would like to share as well on our Instagram, we would like to create aesthetically pleasing content with inspiring, uplifting or calming quotes on TikTok. In this situation, the quotes will be said out loud. We see a trend that content as such is often being reposted on TikTok as well as Instagram and the sounds of this content are being used behind other people’s videos as well (think about Instagram’s and TikTok’s feature: use this sound). With this approach, we believe that we can improve our social media presence and increase our brand awareness in a more successful way. Nonetheless, we can stick more to our own identity rather than taking on the identity of others. 
<br><br>
Furthermore, we have had a certain structure and frequency in how often we would share content on our social media. Yet again, because we have done this before we already learned a bit more on when we would and would not want to post. We are definitely sticking with posting in the morning and in the evening, our target audience is the most active on social media during these times as they are working during the daytime. Besides this, we are sticking to the following days for the future: Monday till Friday. We are going to stop posting on the weekend as we realized that engagement is lower on the weekends. Our theory on this is that our target audience is generally busy throughout the week with work, and social activities as well as practical activities are done during the weekends. We are adding posts to Tuesday and Thursday. For Instagram, we are sticking to the times of 07:00 in the morning and 19:00 in the evening. We have initially picked these times as they fall perfectly before and after the worktimes of our target audience. Furthermore, we post lighter content in the mornings as our target audience generally pays less attention to what they see online in the morning due to the lack of time. For TikTok, we are posting two times per week. This will be on Wednesdays and Fridays in the evenings, also at 19:00. The same TikTok’s will be shared on our Instagram at the same time.<br><br>

<h4> Our Content </h4>
	<p> As you can see, we did not reach the 100 followers that we had set as an objective. Compared to our previous campaign we now used more video content and had a stronger strategy. We did reach the impressions on our posts on Instagram as we wanted! With a good 1000 impressions. </p>
